This node app is a simple simulation that allows for basic manipulation of data in a MYSQL database.

Clients may choose a product from a list and define the amount they would like to purchase. 
They are then given the cost of the purchse (if there is sufficient stock) and the database is updated.
The client may then choose to continue shopping or not. 
If they choose to continue, they will be redirected to the initial shopping list.
If not, the app terminates.
